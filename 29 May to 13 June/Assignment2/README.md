# YOLO Implementation

In my first year as an undergraduate, I implemented YOLO (You Only Look Once) to understand its workings using **OpenCV**. Now, with foundational knowledge in neural networks, JAX, and Haiku, I am reimplementing the algorithm in JAX.

## Tools

- **YOLO**
- **JAX**
- **Haiku**
